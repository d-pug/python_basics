    "As you begin learning to code in Python, you'll want to check that your code is behaving as expected. One of the ways to do so is to print, well, basically everything. The `print()` function is one of the most widely used functions. Functions are a more complicated aspect of Python, so for now, you just need to know that a function looks something like this: `function()`, where the function name is outside of the parentheses, and the parentheses are there to take arguments. An argument is something you give a function as an input. In this case, our function is `print`, and our argument (input) is \"Hello, World!\". "
